//VARIABLES (var)
//var or let can be used to name different variables which will be used in the future.
//STRING (TYPE OF VALUE): a sequence of characters (usually a name to determine a variables value)
// Example:
var a = "Mosh"
var b
var c 

// Cannot be reserved
// Cannot start with a number (1patrick)
// Cannot contain a space or a hyphen (-)
// Should be meaningful (not a, b, a1, etc...)
// Are case sensitive (a variable named 'A' is different from 'a'

//CONSTANTS (const)
//the value of a variable CAN change. The value of a constant however, CAN't change.
//If you don't need to reassign a variable, const is the best choice. Otherwise, if you need to reassign a variable, use var or let.
